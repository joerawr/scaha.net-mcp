## Problem
Agent applications integrating with the SCAHA MCP server had no way to verify if the MCP server was functioning correctly before debugging their own integration code. This led to wasted time debugging agent app code when the actual issue was in the MCP server (or vice versa).

Additionally, the `get_schedule` tool was using a broken HTTP scraper instead of working browser automation, causing it to return empty results.

## Solution

1. **Integration Test Suite**: Implemented comprehensive integration tests (12 tests) that verify all working MCP tools against live scaha.net data
   - Created `tests/integration/mcp-tools.test.ts` with tests for all working tools
   - Added test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/expected-responses.json` with known stable data
   - Tests use verified data: Jr. Kings (1) vs Heat on 2025-10-05 at 16:15

2. **Health Check Endpoint**: Added `/mcp/health` endpoint for quick verification
   - Returns server status and tool availability
   - Lists which tools are working vs need testing
   - Fast check without running full test suite

3. **Fixed `get_schedule` Tool**: Updated to use browser automation instead of broken HTTP scraper
   - Now parses CSV from `downloadScheduleCSVWithBrowser`
   - Supports date filtering (`date` parameter)
   - Matches working tools' parameter format (season: "2025/26", schedule: "14U B")

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with integration testing section
   - Updated `Implement_Scaha_MCP.md` with test-first workflow and debugging guidance
   - Created `tests/README.md` with comprehensive testing documentation
   - Created `TESTING.md` as quick reference guide

5. **NPM Scripts**: Added convenience scripts
   - `npm run test:health` - Quick health check via curl
   - `npm run test:integration` - Run all integration tests
   - `npm run test:watch` - Watch mode for development
   - `npm run test:ui` - Interactive test UI

6. **Vitest Configuration**: Added `vitest.config.ts` with 30-second timeouts for browser automation

## Rabbit holes

- Don't try to test `get_team_stats` or `get_player_stats` yet - they likely need the same browser automation fix but are marked as "needs testing"
- Avoid testing against constantly changing data - use known stable fixtures (Jr. Kings schedule)
- Don't add tests that depend on exact score values or game counts - test structure, not values
- Avoid reducing test timeouts below 30 seconds - browser automation needs time

## No gos

- Don't change the MCP tool parameter formats now that tests are passing
- Don't modify `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` or `mcp-handler` versions
- Don't remove browser automation in favor of HTTP scraping (it doesn't work for SCAHA)
- Don't add dependencies beyond vitest for testing
- Don't test against production/deployed servers - tests should work locally
